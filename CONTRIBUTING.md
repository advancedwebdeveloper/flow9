# How to contribute to Flow

### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/area9innovation/flow9/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/area9innovation/flow9/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* We suggest you discuss the change in either the Telegram chat or the Groups.io group.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Flow in the [flow mailing list](flow).

### **Do you want to contribute to the Flow documentation?**

Flow is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join the team!

Thanks!
